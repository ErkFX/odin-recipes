                <h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>This lobster roll recipe is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy lunch that will impress your friends. I grew up in Nova Scotia, where seafood was cheap. My mom and grandmothers had some pretty inventive ways of making lobster not dull. Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune! I've paid over $10 for a lobster roll in Cape Cod, and it wasn't half as good — or as big — as this one!</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 tablespoon butter, softened</li>
                        <li>4 hot dog buns or kaiser rolls, split</li>
                        <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
                        <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon fresh lime juice</li>
                        <li>1 dash hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco)</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

                        <li>1 pinch dried basil, parsley or tarragon</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Lightly butter the insides of buns and line with lettuce leaves. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Stir together mayonnaise, lime juice, hot pepper sauce, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until well blended. Mix in green onions and celery. Gently fold in lobster until just coated.</li>
