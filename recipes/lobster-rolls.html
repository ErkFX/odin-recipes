                        <p class="description-para">This lobster roll recipe is a wonderful summer (or winter) treat and makes a fancy lunch that will impress your friends. I grew up in Nova Scotia, where seafood was cheap. My mom and grandmothers had some pretty inventive ways of making lobster not dull. Now, lobster is a treat and costs a fortune! I've paid over $10 for a lobster roll in Cape Cod, and it wasn't half as good — or as big — as this one!</p>
